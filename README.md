Excited to showcase my latest Tableau project: Airbnb NYC Dashboard! This interactive dashboard provides key insights into Airbnb dataset for New York City, including:

✅ Total bookings by month and neighbourhood group 
✅ Total neighbourhoods by neighbourhood groups
✅ Top 10 hosts by total reviews
✅ Total bookings by neighbourhood group and room type
✅ Total reviews by year
✅ Average price by neighbourhood group 

Checkout interactive dashboard!!

🚀 I’m excited to continue learning and can’t wait to continue working on more data-driven projects! 🚀

Would love to hear your thoughts! Any suggestions for improvement or new visualization ideas☺️.
